# Sales & Profitability Analysis — Imprimimos

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes historical sales and profitability data for *Imprimimos*, a printing company, with the goal of identifying key revenue drivers, margin behavior, and potential business risks. The analysis focuses on transforming raw transactional data into clear, decision-ready insights using a structured, business-first analytical approach.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw sales data for reliable analysis  
- Identify revenue concentration across clients  
- Evaluate profitability by job type  
- Explore time-based trends in sales performance  
- Translate findings into actionable business recommendations  

---

## 🏢 Business Context
Businesses rely on sales and profitability data to guide pricing, sales strategy, and operational planning. However, raw transactional data is often messy, inconsistent, or incomplete, which can lead to misleading conclusions if not handled properly.

This project simulates a real-world analytics scenario where the primary challenge is not just analysis, but **data quality, validation, and clear communication of insights** to support decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Approach
The analysis follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Standardized column formats and data types  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values  
   - Created time-based features for trend analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed revenue and margins by client and job type  
   - Examined distributions, trends, and concentration risks  
   - Used visualizations to support insight discovery  

3. **Insight Framing & Storytelling**  
   - Structured findings with executive summaries and key takeaways  
   - Focused on business implications rather than raw metrics  
   - Documented assumptions and limitations  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Revenue is highly concentrated among a small number of clients, creating dependency risk  
- Seasonality is clear: demand is strongest in February and July, and weakest in December
- The business has shifted from physical to digital channels since 2018, with digital now the dominant driver 

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Prioritize sales and pricing strategies around high-margin services  
- Strengthen relationships with top clients while exploring diversification opportunities  
- Use historical trends to support capacity planning and revenue forecasting

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Analysis is based solely on historical transactional data  
- Cost structure, marketing efforts, and operational constraints were not included  
- Results should be interpreted as directional insights rather than precise forecasts  

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
With additional data, this analysis could be extended to:
- Customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis  
- Cost-based margin modeling  
- Revenue forecasting using statistical or ML models  
- Interactive dashboards for ongoing monitoring
